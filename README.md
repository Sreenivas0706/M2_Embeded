A railway signal is a visual display device that conveys instructions or provides warning of instructions regarding the driverâ€™s authority to proceed. The driver interprets the signal's indication and acts accordingly. Typically, a signal might inform the driver of the speed at which the train may safely proceed or it may instruct the driver to stop.
